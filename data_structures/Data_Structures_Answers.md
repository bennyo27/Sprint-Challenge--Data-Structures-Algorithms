Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
   O(N) \* O(1) = O(N)
4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
   O(N)
5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
   O(N log(N)) because O(N) is from traversing the array and sifting through the heap creates the time complexity of O(log(N))
6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
   It has O(N) if it returns a new array but it if returned the the same array, it would have a space complexity of O(1)
